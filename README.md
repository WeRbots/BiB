#  First document: BOM for prototype

What is needed are the following components which you may obtain anywhere:

1.  Beagle Bone Black Single Board Computer  
2.  5V 2A Note: Mine is Chinese Unit 5V 2.5A (the extra power pays off, so I use a wireless keyboard
3.  Cable microHD to HD
4.  Monitor (anything HD) Note: You don't really need this for a final product, but it's nice to have
  I use Sony 720p TV, it has timing issues, so part of the screen only shows partial at the edges
5.  USB 2 4-Port Hub 
6.  Cat 5 Cable connection (or wireless dongle plugged into Hub)

Connect BBB to 5v wall wart supply, plug in USB, plug in microHD cable to monitor, push on switch on BBB, wait
for bootup.  

Now you should have a working Linux "box"...  Get familiar with the BBB by surfing, playing with camers, etc...

Download the BiB code and follow the instruction for installing.

You will get a new OS upgrade, you will also get the software we spec'd in the BiB, reboot and you should come 
up in the server as a "cloud" connection, or IP number, I don't know which yet.

Enjoy
